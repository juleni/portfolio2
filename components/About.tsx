            Ever since I was a child, during my studies at primary school (90s
            of the last century) I was enchanted by computers - in that time
            8-bit Didactics Alpha, where I gained my first experience with
            programming in the Basic programming language. Later, while studying
            at the Secondary Grammar School, I bought my first computer PP-06.3
            (PC XT), on which I learned to work in MS-DOS by my own efforts and
            started creating my first programs in Turbo Basic and Pascal.
            <br />
            I continued my IT direction during my studies at the University of
            Å½ilina. At that time, I programmed in Delphi, C++, but I was
            fascinated by JAVA, which began to grow and develop at that time, as
            well as working with relational databases and SQL. In the fourth
            year, I started programming web together with a group of four other
            guys. We used JAVA, JSP, Pearl, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
            technologies.
            <br />
            After graduating from university, I worked as a full-time programmer
            for the next five years, until I got married and then I stayed at
            home and took care of the children, 10 years dealing with real
            estate activities and next 5 years working as web administrator and
            manager in the largest beekeeping store in Slovakia. I still missed
            programming during this long period, but due to time and family
            reasons, I could no longer fully devote myself to it.
            <br />
            From the end of 2019, I started to think about returning to
            programming, since I no longer saw any knowledge shift in my work at
            the time.
            <br />
            In the evenings and my free time, I started studying the JAVA and
            JavaScript languages again, especially the changes that took place
            during that time. I was very interested in the Java Spring, as well
            as Node.js and React framework.
            <br />
            From May 2021, I started working as a full-stack developer in an
            international IT corporation, where I participated in various
            projects. I programmed in JavaScript, Typescript, React, a bit of C#
            and Azure. I learned agile development as well.
            <br />
            I created a few of my personal projects in React to try and learn
            new things.
            <br />I still really enjoy programming despite my 15-year hiatus,
            and I would like to continue to do so in the future.
